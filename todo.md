- fitler client returned in pull to just those in same client group
- don't bump client version when no changes
- decide on client_view_record vs client_view
- make sure all files are snake_case
- make sure all tables and columns are snake_case
- add lease to pull
- put paging back (by way of expanding a window incrementally that controls what we are syncing)
